# 🚀 TeamFlow — Modern SaaS Starter

TeamFlow is a modern full-stack starter for building production-grade SaaS applications with Next.js.  
It gives you a strong technical foundation for dashboards, admin panels, internal tools, task managers, CRMs, and other B2B/B2C products.

## ✨ Tech Stack

- ⚡ Next.js 15 (App Router)
- 📘 TypeScript 5
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS 4
- 🧩 shadcn/ui (Radix UI components)
- 🧠 Zustand for state management
- 🔄 TanStack Query for server state and caching
- 🗄️ Prisma ORM for database access
- 🔐 NextAuth.js for authentication
- 🌍 next-intl for internationalization
- 📊 TanStack Table, Recharts for data displays
- 🖱️ DND Kit for drag and drop interactions

## 🎯 What TeamFlow Is For

TeamFlow is designed as a flexible foundation you can adapt to many use cases:

- Task and project management (Kanban boards, statuses, priorities)
- Team collaboration (members, roles, permissions)
- Analytics and reporting (tables, charts, dashboards)
- Internal admin panels and back-office tools
- Any modern SaaS-style web application that needs a solid base

The goal is to provide a production-ready architecture and modern UI so you can focus on your product logic instead of boilerplate setup.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🔧 What You Can Build On Top

Here are a few ideas you can implement on top of TeamFlow:

- A Kanban-style team task manager
- A lightweight CRM with pipelines and activities
- An internal admin panel for an existing product
- An education/learning dashboard with progress tracking and analytics

TeamFlow is not a finished product.  
It is a foundation you own and extend to match your specific business needs.
